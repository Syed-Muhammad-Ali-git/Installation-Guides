In Default Next js install Typescript, Tailwind css, Es lint, app Folder directory and its latest versions, 

and also install node modules, react, react router.


Note:

All things in Next js like a Advanced version of React js, So if you want to learn Next js first you learn React js.


Advanced Features of Next js:

1. In Next js we use page.tsx file name to auto render in Dom. Using page.tsx name Only those files who will render on screen.
   This is called File base routing.

2. in Next we use Link from Next/Link for linked 1 page to another pages link in Html we use anchor (a) tag for linked pages.

3. For Not found page we make ( not-found.tsx ) inside app folder on layout.tsx directory, it can auto connected with project pages.

4. If we want to made error page for show on error then we can make it ( error.tsx ) in same directory of notfound page.

5. If we show a loader in any screen we make loader.tsx in the screen folder where page.tsx file like, 


app (folder)
  |
  |--users (folder)
         |
         |--page.tsx  ( /user screen on dom)
         |--loader.tsx ( loader for screen if we need we use it )



6. If we want to make page inside page show in dom and its url like ( localhost:3000/profile/avator ).
   so we make page folder inside page folder like,


app (folder)
  |
  |--profile (folder)
         |
         |--page.tsx  ( /profile screen on dom)
         |
         |--[avator] (folder)
                 |
                 |--page.tsx ( /profile/avator )


7. Next js is a case sensitive so the name of files and folders you write Becareful like,
   we wrote the file name [avator] beacause this is the nested folder of file 
   show in url ( localhost:3000/profile/avator ).
