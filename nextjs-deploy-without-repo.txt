🚀 Deploy Next.js Project on Vercel — Without GitHub or Any Repo

Tired of pushing your code to GitHub just to deploy it? 😩
Here’s how you can deploy your Next.js app directly from your local machine using Vercel CLI — no GitHub, no repo, just magic! 🪄

🧠 What You’ll Need

Node.js installed

A Vercel account → https://vercel.com

Your Next.js project ready on your local machine

⚙️ Step-by-Step Guide
1️⃣ Install Vercel CLI

Run this command globally in your terminal:

npm install -g vercel

2️⃣ Login to Vercel

Authenticate your account:

vercel login


Enter your email → confirm from your inbox → you’re logged in ✅

3️⃣ Navigate to Your Project Folder

Go inside your Next.js project directory:

cd your-project-folder


Make sure this folder has:

pages/
public/
package.json
next.config.js

4️⃣ Deploy with a Single Command

Now, just run:

vercel


You’ll see a few setup questions:

? Set up and deploy “your-project-name”?  Yes
? Which scope do you want to deploy to?  yourname
? Link to existing project?  No
? What’s your project’s name?  (press Enter)
? In which directory is your code located?  ./  (press Enter)
? Want to modify these settings?  No
? Want to change additional project settings?  No


Vercel will automatically:

Install dependencies (npm install)

Build your app (next build)

Host it on a free Vercel domain 🎉

5️⃣ Get Your Live URL

Once done, you’ll see something like this:

✅  Deployment complete!
    https://your-app-name.vercel.app


That’s your live Next.js website — fully functional with SSR, API routes, and dynamic pages! ⚡

💥 Optional: Update or Redeploy Later

If you make changes later:

vercel --prod


Vercel will detect your existing project and redeploy it instantly 🔁

💡 Why This Method Rocks

✅ No GitHub, no repo
✅ Full Next.js support (SSR + API routes)
✅ Free hosting forever
✅ Fastest deployment method for local projects
